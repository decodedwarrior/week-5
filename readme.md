# Week 5: Database Management with MongoDB & Integration

This week's focus is on mastering database management using MongoDB and seamlessly integrating it with your Node.js backend. We will also delve into building a robust user authentication system.

## Detailed Tasks:

* **Deep Dive into MongoDB (CRUD Operations & Mongoose ORM):**
    * Understand the core concepts of MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
    * Learn and practice the fundamental **CRUD** operations:
        * **Create:** Inserting new documents into collections.
        * **Read:** Querying and retrieving documents.
        * **Update:** Modifying existing documents.
        * **Delete:** Removing documents from collections.
    * Explore **Mongoose**, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB. Mongoose simplifies interaction with MongoDB by providing schema and model-based data modeling, validation, and more. You will learn how to define schemas, create models, and use them to interact with your MongoDB database in a structured way.

* **Connecting Node.js Backend to MongoDB:**
    * Learn the process of establishing a connection between your Node.js server-side application and a MongoDB database instance.
    * Utilize the Mongoose library to handle the connection, manage database interactions, and ensure smooth data flow between your backend and the database.

* **Building a User Authentication System (Login/Signup):**
    * Implement a complete user authentication mechanism, allowing users to register and securely log in to your application. This involves several key steps:
        * **User Data Modeling:** Designing and creating a user schema using Mongoose to define the structure of user data in your MongoDB database (e.g., username, email, password).
        * **User Registration (Signup):** Implementing functionality for new users to create accounts. This includes handling user input, validating data, and securely storing user credentials (crucially, by hashing passwords using libraries like bcrypt to prevent storing them in plain text).
        * **User Login:** Implementing the login process, which involves receiving user credentials, querying the database for the user, comparing the entered password with the stored (hashed) password, and establishing a user session upon successful authentication.
        * **Session Management (Optional but Recommended):** Understanding how to maintain user sessions after login, often involving techniques like using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or server-side sessions to keep users logged in across requests.

By the end of this week, you will have gained practical experience in managing data with MongoDB through Node.js, leveraging the power of Mongoose, and implementing a fundamental yet crucial feature: user authentication.
